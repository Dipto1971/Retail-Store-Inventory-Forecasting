# Literature Review on Retail Sales Forecasting Models and Applications

Hasan et al. [1] benchmarked forecasting models on historical sales data from Walmart to predict their future sales. They provided a comprehensive theoretical overview and analysis of the state-of-the-art time series forecasting models. Then, they applied these models to the forecasting challenge dataset (M5 forecasting by Kaggle). Results suggested that the ARIMA model outperforms the Facebook Prophet and LightGBM models, while the LightGBM model achieves huge computational gain for the large dataset with negligible compromise in the prediction accuracy. In this paper, they used time-series data obtained from M5 forecasting-accuracy Kaggle to predict future sales of Walmart products for the subsequent 28 days. They implemented the ARIMA, advanced models, including the Prophet model from Facebook and the LightGBM model from Microsoft, which utilize gradient boosting techniques for improved computational performance. Further work includes developing an ensemble model using the benchmarked models and optimizing the performance to minimize RMSE further. LightGBM provides nearly similar RMSE as ARIMA, in addition to its considerably faster implementation time when considering the whole dataset.

Building upon time series forecasting approaches, Haque et al. [2] addressed the gap in retail demand forecasting by implementing macroeconomic variables such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and unemployment rates into time series data, alongside historical sales. Their study developed and compared regression and machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy, emphasizing the importance of these factors in consumer spending behavior. The results demonstrated that integrating these external economic indicators enhances the forecasting models' ability to predict retail demand more effectively. The authors employed a range of regression and machine learning techniques to predict retail demand, integrating macroeconomic indicators with historical sales data. They compared the performance of these models to identify the most effective approach for incorporating external economic factors into forecasting. Their comparative analysis revealed that certain models, particularly those capable of handling multivariate time series, achieved higher accuracy in forecasting demand. Future research could explore the inclusion of additional macroeconomic variables or apply the forecasting models to different retail contexts to further validate their effectiveness. As they noted, "Our findings fortify the findings from a previous study in the current literature in a more generalizable manner – that by including external macroeconomic data into our models we can improve the predictive accuracy, and that these findings obtained from an LSTM model in the current literature are also valid for other relevant models in the machine learning horizon."

Furthermore, Singhal et al. [3] explored artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the Random Forest Regressor (RFR), to enhance demand forecasting, pricing, and inventory management in retail by analyzing factors such as competitor pricing, customer preferences, and inventory levels, achieving mean squared errors (MSE) of 8.15% for demand forecasting and 1.11% for price prediction. The authors employed the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for both demand forecasting and price prediction, training the models on historical data with features including product prices, competitor prices, customer preferences, and seasonal trends for demand forecasting, and competitor prices, inventory levels, and customer preferences for price prediction. They evaluated the models using mean squared error (MSE). A rule-based system was implemented for inventory management, using the demand forecasts to determine restocking needs based on predefined thresholds. Future studies could investigate the incorporation of more diverse datasets and explore the model's applicability in different retail sectors to enhance its generalizability and effectiveness further.

Addressing the limitations of traditional methods, Poongothai [4] stated that "Traditional inventory forecasting methods often struggle with the dynamic and complex nature of retail environments." The paper addressed the challenge of retail store inventory forecasting by employing a hybrid forecasting model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). The model was trained using a two-step process: The LSTM component captures nonlinear patterns in retail sales data, such as sudden demand spikes or seasonal variations, while the ARIMA component addresses linear trends, like gradual sales increases over time. The dataset was collected from a major retail chain, encompassing three years of daily sales data across multiple product categories. It includes variables such as sales volume, promotional activities, and external factors like holidays and weather conditions. The authors suggest extending the model to incorporate real-time data streams and exploring the integration of additional external factors, such as economic indicators, to further enhance forecasting accuracy. The paper discusses how traditional methods falter in dynamic retail contexts, a challenge the hybrid model overcomes by addressing both nonlinear and linear data patterns.

Likewise, Falatouri et al. [5] explored predictive analytics for demand forecasting in retail supply chain management (SCM). Their findings revealed that LSTM performed better for products with stable demand, while SARIMA was more effective for seasonal items. Additionally, SARIMAX, which includes external promotional factors, significantly improved forecasting accuracy for products influenced by promotions. The dataset comprised more than 37 months of actual retail sales data collected from an Austrian retailer. The results revealed that for salad, SARIMA achieved an MAPE of 13 and an RMSE of 1009 compared to LSTM's MAPE of 14 and RMSE of 949, while for tomato, LSTM recorded an MAPE of 44 and an RMSE of 1170 versus SARIMA's MAPE of 48 and RMSE of 1163. For potato, LSTM outperformed SARIMA with an MAPE of 15 and an RMSE of 1184 compared to SARIMA's MAPE of 25 and RMSE of 1626, whereas for cucumber, SARIMA was superior with a MAPE of 16 and RMSE of 2854 against LSTM's MAPE of 35 and RMSE of 4502. Incorporating external factors using the SARIMAX model improved forecasting accuracy significantly: salad's MAPE dropped from 13 to 6 (a 53% improvement) and tomato's from its baseline to a 54% improvement, while potato and cucumber saw improvements of 28% and 12.5%, respectively. Overall, these findings underscore that the effectiveness of forecasting models in retail SCM is highly dependent on product characteristics and the integration of external promotional factors.

Extending the hybrid approach further, Taparia et al. [6] proposed a demand prediction model that considers historical demand data and the SKU price to forecast the demand. They evaluated the approach on 1000 SKUs, and the result showed that the Random Forest is the best-performing regressor algorithm with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8%. Furthermore, the hybrid model resulted in a lower inventory and lost sales cost with a MAPE of 7.74%. The dataset was collected from a retail store and contains weekly demand and price data for 1000 SKUs over 104 weeks, along with competitor and competitive commodity price data. The study evaluates five machine learning regression algorithms—Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Random Forest Regression (RF)—to predict demand for each SKU using historical demand and price data. A hybrid model is developed by selecting the best two performing algorithms for each SKU based on the lowest sum of absolute deviations, then aggregating their predictions into a new dataset fed into LR for final forecasting. The process involves training on 53-82 weeks of data, tuning the hybrid model on 83-97 weeks, and testing on 98-104 weeks, with inputs including optimized exponential smoothing predictions, trend-seasonality factors, and pricing variables. As the authors noted, "This study may thus be extended by incorporating more parameters and exploring more advanced regression algorithms." They concluded that "The proposed hybrid model of machine learning algorithms can significantly improve demand forecasting accuracy for retailers."

In a novel approach, Bi et al. [7] proposed a demand-aware tensor factorization approach, termed ATLAS. When evaluated on eight datasets from the IRI database, spanning various product categories like blades, coffee, and milk, ATLAS outperformed benchmarks like SARIMA, VAR, LSTM, and other tensor-based methods (BPTF, libFM, TRMF, CPD) across various scenarios, including different prediction horizons (Appendix 11) and data densities (Appendix 14), with notable improvements in RMSE. RMSE improvements ranging from 10% to 30%. The ATLAS model employs tensor factorization to decompose sales data into latent factors. This regularization captures sales interactions, such as competition or collaboration, by penalizing deviations from expected covariance structures in the latent factors, as detailed in the derivation of the regularization function (fg). The process begins with an alternating least squares (ALS) approach for regularized SVD (Appendix 1), followed by integration with time-series models like SARIMA (Appendix 3) or LSTM (Appendix 4), where the tensor's completed values serve as inputs for final sales predictions. The data originates from the IRI database, consisting of weekly sales records for eight product categories (e.g., blades, coffee, deodorant, diapers, frozen pizza, milk, photography, toothpaste) across 1,560 grocery stores over 208 weeks, from January 2008 to December 2011. This dataset, detailed in Appendix 8, provides a rich basis for testing, with sales amounts per product per store per week showing significant variation (e.g., mean sales ranging from $5.88 for deodorant to $110.14 for milk). The authors suggest that future research could enhance ATLAS by incorporating additional external factors, such as economic indicators or more detailed promotion data, to further improve forecasting accuracy.

Kumar et al. [8] investigated how AI optimizes inventory levels and enhances demand forecasting. Various models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks (particularly deep learning models like LSTM), are trained and validated using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, with neural networks showing superior accuracy. The dataset comprises historical sales records, market data, customer feedback, operational data, and external variables like weather conditions and seasonal events, collected to provide a comprehensive basis for AI analysis. Future enhancements may integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time inventory tracking, blockchain for secure data sharing, and advanced machine learning algorithms to further refine AI-driven inventory management and demand forecasting. Neural networks achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.35 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.45 in demand forecasting. AI implementation reduced excess inventory by 20% and stockouts by 15%, driven by automation and real-time monitoring.

Taking a different methodological approach, Baloian et al. [9] developed a methodology that, unlike traditional approaches that rely on current sales levels, uses predicted future sales levels to enable retail managers to simulate various scenarios and set realistic sales goals. The methodology is structured into two primary components, with an additional optimization extension. The first one is the prediction and model selection process- An algorithm evaluates multiple machine learning models—Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost Regression (XGBR), Random Forest, and Weighted Evidence Regression Model (WEVREG). Hyperparameter calibration is performed using an Exhaustive GridSearch which tests the constrained ranges of hyperparameters across all stores. The second one is "Sales goal Setting Model"- Using the predicted indicators (foot traffic Ep, conversion rate Cp, and average transaction value Tp​), the model calculates the necessary percentage changes (VE​, VC​, VT​) to achieve a user-defined sales goal (Sg​). Sales are modeled as 𝑆=𝐸×𝐶×𝑇. The model uses historical coefficients of variation to assign weights (WE​, WC​, WT) that reflect how easily each indicator can change, solving a cubic polynomial equation to determine feasible adjustments. This allows managers to simulate scenarios and identify actionable targets. Specific details about the dataset's source are not provided. The authors propose two main directions for future research: 1. Enhancing the reliability and uniformity of the algorithm's predictions across different stores, 2. Investigating other performance indicators (beyond foot traffic, conversion rate, and average transaction value) that could improve the effectiveness of sales and operation planning for managers. The tool achieves a prediction accuracy exceeding 90%. In a comparison with human performance (HP) across 30 stores, the algorithm's average error was -4.44%, outperforming HP's -7.73%. The algorithm showed slightly better consistency (standard deviation of 0.507 vs. 0.516 for HP) and excelled in more instances (7 vs. 4), particularly where marketing campaigns were underestimated by experts. However, human experts occasionally outperformed the algorithm due to store-specific knowledge.

Saha et al. [10] investigated the use of advanced deep learning techniques to predict sales demand for an American multinational retail company. Their paper introduces two forecasting approaches utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models. The dataset originates from an American multinational retail company and spans sales data from January 29, 2011, to June 19, 2016. A variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) used for time-series forecasting. It employs memory cells with input, forget, and output gates to capture long-term dependencies in the sales data. A gradient boosting framework based on decision trees, optimized for large datasets. It uses leaf-splitting techniques for efficient node division and includes parameters (e.g., learning rate, tree depth) to mitigate overfitting. LightGBM: Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (WRMSSE): 0.6255, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4436, Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2125.28, Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE): 0.1058. LSTM: WRMSSE: 0.7977, RMSE: 5024, MAE: 2379.06, WMAPE: 0.1545. LightGBM outperforms LSTM, delivering lower error rates and better predictions.

Moving beyond individual techniques, Hübner et al. [11] identified cross-cutting store-related planning issues and developed a planning framework for OC operations. They applied industry interviews and a systematic literature analysis to derive five planning issues, providing a comprehensive framework for omnichannel retail operations.

Wang and Gu [12] focused on three major US retail firms—Walmart, Costco, and Kroger. They employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) to identify key economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and regular wage, which significantly influence sales across all three firms. For sales forecasting, Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms in the training set, while Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) excels in the testing set. The Lotka-Volterra Model (LVM) reveals a mutualistic relationship among the firms, suggesting they benefit from each other's presence. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) indicates that Kroger operates less efficiently than Walmart and Costco, though it has potential for greater sales growth under stable conditions. The paper combines statistical learning, machine learning, and operations research techniques to tackle the three core objectives: Sales Forecasting (Predictive Analytics): Lasso identifies critical economic indicators (e.g., CPI, regular wage) by shrinking less relevant predictors. Three models are compared: MARS, SVR, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. SVR achieves the lowest MAPE (e.g., 4.36% for Walmart, 8.48% for Kroger) in the training set, MARS outperforms with MAPEs of 4.27% (Walmart), 10.22% (Costco), and 9.4% (Kroger) in the testing set. Market Analysis (Diagnostic Analytics): Lotka-Volterra Model (LVM). Performance Assessment (Prescriptive Analytics): Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Significant economic indicators are CPI, regular wage, PPI (WM specific- due to upstream sensitivity), oil prices (WM specific), DJT (Costco & Kroger specific due to logistic needs).

In a comprehensive comparison, Martins and Galegale [13] explored the vital role of sales forecasting in retail, addressing challenges like stock shortages and excess inventory due to inaccurate predictions. An integrative literature review (ILR) compares traditional forecasting methods, such as time series models (e.g., Simple Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA), with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB). The analysis draws from diverse datasets, including proprietary sales records from supermarket chains (e.g., 1,510,563 transactions from IRI Marketing Research) and Japanese point-of-sale data, alongside public datasets like Kaggle's 8,523-entry collection, spanning millions of transactions. The study conducts an ILR using the PRISMA-P protocol to systematically review nine recent publications on sales forecasting. It evaluates traditional time series models against machine learning algorithms across various retail contexts, employing metrics like RMSE, MAPE, accuracy, and AUC. Machine learning outperforms traditional methods in accuracy, especially with exogenous and endogenous variables, and excels at identifying hidden demand patterns, though traditional methods may suffice in stable markets due to their simplicity and lower cost.

Best et al. [14] developed a simulation model of a retail store that incorporates various error-prone processes based on input from retailers. They conducted a full factorial test design to analyze how different operational errors contribute to inventory discrepancies, with particular focus on positive inventory record inaccuracies. The dataset was developed through collaboration with professionals from eight different retail companies and associations who participated in the researchers' practitioner workshop. They conducted a full factorial test design to analyze how different operational errors contribute to inventory discrepancies, with particular focus on positive inventory record inaccuracies. Future research could focus on developing specific countermeasures for each type of positive inventory discrepancy identified in the study. Retailers need to adjust specific process parameters to avoid inventory records becoming inaccurate, with phantom products playing a significant role in retail stockouts.

Similarly, Esrar et al. [15] examined how a large-scale retail chain can improve its handling of excess seasonal inventory using three common strategies: information sharing, visibility, and collaboration. The research employed a case study method focusing on one retail chain at three key organizational levels: strategic (head office), warehouses, and retail stores. The dataset was collected through primary research involving semi-structured interviews with senior-level employees at the strategic level (head office), warehouses, and retail stores of a Canadian big-box retailer. Future research could explore multicultural aspects of inventory management in the Canadian context, which was noted as particularly interesting due to the country's diverse demographics. The Implementation of information sharing, visibility, and collaboration strategies significantly improved the retailer's seasonal inventory management, despite challenges related to human errors, forecasting limitations, and return merchandise handling.

Wellens et al. [16] demonstrated that simple implementations of tree-based machine learning methods can substantially outperform traditional statistical forecasting techniques in retail while remaining computationally efficient. The study validates this approach using a dataset of 4,523 products from a leading Belgian retailer with various explanatory variables, including promotions and national events. The researchers compared various tree-based machine learning methods with different complexity levels against popular statistical methods for forecast accuracy, bias, and inventory performance. They utilized Shapley values and, for validation purposes, applied their framework to both their private dataset and the M5 competition dataset, ensuring their insights were structural and not specific to one dataset. Future research could focus on strategies to increase the adoption rate of machine learning forecasting methods among traditional retailers who currently rely on simpler statistical techniques. A simple, off-the-shelf tree-based machine learning implementation can improve forecast accuracy by 11.48% compared to traditional methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Nasseri et al. [17] compared tree-based ensemble forecasting (specifically Extra Tree Regressors/ETRs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for retail demand prediction. The dataset consisted of historical demand data from a prominent Austrian retailer, encompassing daily demand for over 330 products across three main categories (fruits, fresh meat, soft drinks), totaling 5.2 million records over a 76-month period (January 2016 to February 2022), supplemented with internal data (pricing, promotions) and external variables (calendar data, weather conditions, COVID-19 information). The researchers developed a comprehensive methodology that included data preparation, feature creation (including lagged demand features for previous days/weeks), feature scaling and encoding, feature selection, and model training. They employed two primary models: an Extra Tree Regressor ensemble model using a bagging approach with 300 trees and a deep learning model combining LSTM layers for temporal features and dense layers for non-temporal features. Both models were evaluated using four metrics (MAPE, MAE, RMSE, and R²) on a test dataset covering the period from January 2021 to February 2022. Future research could compare tree-based ensembles and deep learning approaches based on different time horizons, focusing on short-term, medium-term, and long-term demand predictions. Tree-based ensemble models, particularly ETR, consistently outperformed LSTM in retail demand forecasting across all product categories, showing particular strength in predicting demand for fresh meat products while offering advantages in terms of lower data preparation requirements, better interpretability, and more efficient training.

Most recently, [18] focused on improving prediction accuracy by implementing and comparing various models including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost. The dataset used for this research was sourced from Favorita Stores, a retail chain in Ecuador. The methodology included hyperparameter tuning through randomized search cross-validation to optimize key parameters such as the number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split for the RF model, with the objective of minimizing root mean squared error (RMSE). Future research should incorporate external variables and explore other advanced models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and hybrid models combining multiple algorithms for potentially better results. Through hyperparameter tuning with randomized search cross-validation, the optimized RF model achieved an R-squared value of 0.945, substantially outperforming both the initial RF model and traditional LR, which had an R-squared of 0.531.
