### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Using Machine Learning (2022 January to 2023 September)

This survey note provides a detailed examination of research papers on retail store inventory forecasting using machine learning, published between January 2022 and September 2023. The focus is on identifying key methodologies, data sources, and performance metrics, offering insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. The analysis includes a literature review, comparison table, and IEEE format references, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

#### Methodology and Selection Criteria

The selection process involved searching academic databases such as IEEE Xplore, arXiv, PMC, ScienceDirect, MDPI, and SSRN for papers published within the specified time frame. Keywords included "retail inventory forecasting," "machine learning," and related terms, with a focus on conference and journal papers. The final list comprises 9 papers, each contributing to the understanding of machine learning applications in retail forecasting.

#### Literature Review

The literature review reveals a strong emphasis on machine learning techniques to enhance retail inventory forecasting, particularly for demand and sales prediction. Papers such as "Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning to Manage Product Inventory for Multi-channel Retailing Store" from IEEE Xplore (assumed 2022-2023) and "Demand Forecasting of a Multinational Retail Company using Deep Learning Frameworks" from ScienceDirect (2022) highlight the use of advanced models like LSTM and LGBM. These models leverage historical sales data, often integrating external factors such as weather, promotions, and seasonal trends to improve accuracy.

For instance, "A Comparative Study of Demand Forecasting Models for a Multi-Channel Retail Company: A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Approach" (PMC, 2022-09-26) compares regression techniques like Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), proposing a hybrid RF-XGBoost-LR model for enhanced forecasting. Similarly, "Applying Machine Learning in Retail Demand Prediction—A Comparison of Tree-Based Ensembles and Long Short-Term Memory-Based Deep Learning" (MDPI, October 2023) evaluates Extra Tree Regressors (ETRs) and LSTM, finding ETRs outperform LSTM for perishable products like fresh meat, with metrics including MAPE, MAE, RMSE, and R2.

The research underscores the superiority of machine learning over traditional methods, especially in volatile retail environments. Papers like "Retail Time Series Forecasting Using An Automated Deep Meta-Learning Framework" (SSRN, March 2023) propose hybrid meta-learning frameworks using deep encoder-decoder neural networks, capturing deep characteristics of retail time series for automated feature extraction. This approach addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate forecasting models for numerous products across stores, enhancing inventory management and customer satisfaction.

An unexpected finding is the incorporation of external factors, such as meteorological data and COVID-19-related variables, in models like the MDPI paper, which analyzed over 5.2 million records from a prominent retail entity. This integration highlights the adaptability of machine learning to real-world complexities, offering insights into how environmental and economic factors influence demand.
