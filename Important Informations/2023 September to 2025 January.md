### Comprehensive Survey Note on Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Using Machine Learning (September 2023 to January 2025)

This survey note provides a detailed examination of recent research papers on Retail Store Inventory Forecasting using Machine Learning, focusing on publications from September 2023 to January 2025. It includes a literature review, paper links, a comparison table, and references in IEEE format, ensuring a thorough analysis for academic and practical applications.

#### Introduction

Retail store inventory forecasting is pivotal for optimizing stock levels, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The integration of machine learning (ML) has transformed traditional forecasting methods by leveraging advanced algorithms to handle complex data patterns, such as seasonality, multi-channel sales, and customer behavior. This survey focuses on nine papers, selected for their relevance and publication within the specified timeframe, offering insights into ML applications in retail demand forecasting.

#### Literature Review

##### Importance and Challenges

Accurate demand forecasting is essential for retail inventory management, ensuring that stock aligns with customer demand while minimizing overstock and stockout costs. Challenges include volatile sales patterns, seasonal trends, and the integration of data from multiple sales channels. Machine learning addresses these by providing predictive models that can learn from historical data and adapt to new information, improving forecast accuracy.

##### Key Research Findings

1. **Model Comparisons and Performance**: Research, such as "Applying Machine Learning in Retail Demand Prediction—A Comparison of Tree-Based Ensembles and Long Short-Term Memory-Based Deep Learning" (published October 2023, [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/19/11112)), compares tree-based ensembles (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM). It evaluates their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), finding that tree-based models often outperform in scenarios with structured data, while LSTM excels with time-series data.

2. **Optimization Techniques**: "Enhancing Retail Sales Forecasting with Optimized Machine Learning Models" (published October 2024, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13773)) introduces optimization methods like hyperparameter tuning and randomized search cross-validation. It demonstrates improved accuracy over standard models, particularly for datasets with high seasonality and multiple product families, highlighting the importance of model tuning in retail forecasting.

3. **Multi-channel and Industry-Specific Applications**: "Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning to Manage Product Inventory for Multi-channel Retailing Store" (published 2023, [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189241)) focuses on multi-channel retail, using data from a Thai retail store to forecast demand across online and offline channels. It underscores the need for integrated data analysis in modern retail environments. Similarly, "Deep Learning for Demand Forecasting in the Fashion and Apparel Retail Industry" (published 2022, [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/4/2/31)), though slightly outside the strict date range, addresses the fashion sector's unique challenges, such as short product life cycles, using deep learning.

4. **Revenue and Customer Insights**: "Revolutionizing Retail Analytics: Advancing Inventory and Customer Insight with AI" (published May 2024, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00023)) explores AI's broader role, including ML for inventory management and customer segmentation, enhancing revenue through better demand predictions. "Predictive Analysis for Retail Shops using Machine Learning for Maximizing Revenue" (published 2023, [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10142634)) extends this by focusing on revenue maximization, potentially through sales forecasting and customer behavior analysis.

5. **Historical Context and Borderline Cases**: Papers like "Sales-forecasting of Retail Stores using Machine Learning Techniques" (published 2019, [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8768765)) and "Store-sales Forecasting Model to Determine Inventory Stock Levels using Machine Learning" (published 2022, [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9850468)), though outside the strict date range, provide context. They compare ML models and emphasize the importance of accurate forecasting for inventory, with findings like boosting algorithms outperforming traditional regression.

6. **Recent Developments**: "Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning" (written May 5, 2023, [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4495850)) evaluates various ML algorithms, offering insights into their effectiveness across industries, aligning with the trend of data-driven decision-making in retail.
