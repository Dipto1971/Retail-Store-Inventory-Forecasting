### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Top Papers on Retail Store Inventory Forecasting

Retail store inventory forecasting is pivotal for optimizing supply chain efficiency, particularly in predicting inventory needs based on diverse features and information. Given your focus on time series analysis and the need for precise predictions, this analysis identifies and evaluates the top 26 papers from Google Scholar, published between 2022 and March 18, 2025, that align with your research area. The process involved searching for relevant papers, extracting key details, and summarizing innovations, with citations and links provided for authenticity.

#### Methodology

The search targeted "retail store inventory forecasting" on Google Scholar, filtering for publications from 2022 to 2025 to ensure relevance. The results were paginated, with each page listing 10 papers, sorted by relevance. To compile the top 26, the first three pages (30 papers) were reviewed, and the first 26 were selected for detailed analysis. Each paper's title, authors, abstract snippet, and link were extracted, and the innovation was inferred from the title and snippet, given the limitations in accessing full texts directly. Citations were formatted based on available source information, such as journal names, volumes, and years, inferred from the URLs.

#### Key Innovations and Trends

The papers reveal several trends:

- **Advanced Machine Learning and AI**: Many papers, such as those by Singhal et al. (2023) and Poongothai (2023), utilize machine learning for demand prediction and inventory optimization, enhancing accuracy over traditional methods.
- **Hybrid Models**: Research like Taparia et al. (2022) develops hybrid machine learning models, combining historical data and SKU prices for improved forecasting.
- **Integration of Diverse Data**: Wang (2022) incorporates economic indicators and dynamic channel interactions, while Haque et al. (2023) use multivariate time series with macroscopic indicators, reflecting a broader data approach.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Saha et al. (2023) apply deep learning for multinational retail demand forecasting, identifying effective methods for better predictions.
- **Emerging Focus Areas**: Unexpectedly, papers like Hübner et al. (2023) explore omnichannel operations, and Wang et al. (2023) use spatial-temporal gradient boosting, considering store locations and customer interactions, which are increasingly relevant in modern retail.
