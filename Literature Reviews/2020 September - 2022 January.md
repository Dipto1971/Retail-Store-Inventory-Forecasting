#### Discussion and Implications

The surveyed papers collectively demonstrate that ML and DL significantly enhance retail inventory forecasting, particularly in handling complex datasets and dynamic market conditions. Meta-learning and deep learning approaches are particularly effective for capturing intricate patterns, while hybrid models show promise for multi-channel retail. The inclusion of special days and external factors like economic indicators further improves accuracy, offering retailers actionable insights for inventory management.

An unexpected detail is the focus on small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in some studies, such as hardware retailers, which broadens the applicability beyond large chains. This highlights ML's scalability across different retail scales, a consideration not always emphasized in forecasting literature.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

Some papers, like those from IEEE Xplore, had publication dates assumed due to limited access, potentially extending beyond January 2022. Future research could explore real-time forecasting using ML, integrating more external data sources like social media trends, and addressing data scarcity in SMEs. The debate on model selection, with varying performance across contexts, suggests a need for context-specific guidelines.
